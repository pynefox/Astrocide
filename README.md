# Astrocide
An astrophotography horror game

Plot: 
A strange comet is detected by scientists 
You, a scientist youself, is tasked with observing and photographing this comet to get data on it.
You are sent out into the middle of the radio quiet/light pollution free zone in the Virginia(s) for this task. 
You set up some smaller equipment up just outside your small cabin in a forest clearing.
Each night you set out to get data.
The comet comes closer each night, until what seems to be a small rouge piece of the comet impacts the nearby area. (Occurs around 25-30% into the game)
It turns out that it was actually a lander for hostile aliens. You will have to fend them off whilst collecting data for the rest of the game (until you are picked up by the science organization that dropped you off)

Gameplay:
Point-and-click, no freeroam.
Your goal is to make it through each night or complete your objective by collecting data (whichever comes first) and survive.
There are 9 nights. You fend off wild animals for nights 1 to 3, animals and a single easy alien on night 4, and only aliens for nights 5 to 9
The wild animals are used to introduce mechanics and ease into the harder difficulty and more aggressive aliens.
You get a flashlight that scares off most creatures. It has unlimited power, but using it interferes with your equipment and slows down data collection.

You will have to occasionally re-allign your telescope. When it does go off course, it makes a beeping sound that can attract whatever is nearby, so it is suggested that you keep it to a minimum. It happens occasionally at random, but is mainly due to flashlight interference (10 seconds of being on)
If you feel like you are in danger, you can run back to your cabin. Doing this too many times or for too long will penalize you by raising your [heat] meter.
A high [heat] value make you quite easily for enemies to track. They temporarily move to your position faster.
Staying in the cabin will get you fired (nights 1 to 3) or killed (nights 4 to 9)
The better you do collecting data, the better you are paid. That money can be used to upgrade equipment and make your nights less frustrating.
